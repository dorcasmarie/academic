Hello! My name is Dorcas Washington and I'm currently the Data Analytics Specialist in the Health Science Library at the University of Cincinnati. Also I'm a full-time PhD student at the University of Cincinnati. I enjoy learning about the applications of machine learning and deep learning in medicine and public health. In my free time I enjoy learning and teaching aerial arts.
