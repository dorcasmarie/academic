Hello! My name is Dorcas Washington and I'm a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Cincinnati. I also work in the Health Science Library as the Data Analytics Specialist. Data analysis and visualization are main focus of my work. As of right now, my interest are in survival analysis and deep learning but that will probably change as I go through my program. My background includes a BA in Mathematics and a MS in Applied Statistics. In my down time, I participate in aerials and listen to podcasts. I made this website because I thought it would be an interesting way to document and share my journey with others.
