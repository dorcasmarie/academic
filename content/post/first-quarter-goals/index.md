Starting in 2021, I plan on writing more about my experience as a graduate student, full-time employee and more. I'm really excited and nervous to share this journey but maybe it will feel less lonely. I decided that I should try to achieve two professional, two personal and two academic goals by March 31st 2021.

Professional 
1. Assist one client in doing data analysis (work has been slow)
2. Join a DSC project and contribute 

Personal
1. Cook more and eat out only once a week
2. Take a private aerial lesson 3 times a month

Academic 
1. Starting using a reference manager 
2. Read 2 papers a month and write summaries or annotate them (still figuring this one out)

Feel free to share your goals with me below or on Twitter.
A lot of people are saying don't put too much pressure on 2021 but I'm naturally excited by all the possibilities, even if they are from home. Hopefully, there are some other people out there who feel the same.
