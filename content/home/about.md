Hello! My name is Dorcas Washington and I'm a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Cincinnati. I also work in the Health Science Library as the Data Analytics Specialist. Data analysis and  visualization are my what I mainly focus on at work. As of right now, my interest are in survival analysis and big data but that will probably change as I go through my program. My background includes a BA in Mathematics and a MS in Applied Statistics. In my down time, I participate in aerials and listen to podcasts. I made this website because I thought it would be an interesting way to document and share my journey with others.
