In April, I finished my second semester of my PhD program at the University of Cincinnati. I was so exhausted by the end of the term and in need of a break that a good of mine and I decided to head West to California for a few days. 

During out May visit to LA, we visited some friends, and my family who I had seen for a couple years due to distance and the pandemic. I enjoyed lots of mimosas and visited the beach - which is exactly what I needed! 

Upon arriving back to Ohio, I spent sometime relaxing with my friends at an aerial studio I volunteer and take classes at. It was late May, when I realized how quickly the summer was going by so I packed up my car and visited my hometown in Illinois. It was wonderful seeing my parents for the first time in over a year, which happened to be the longest I've ever gone without seeing them. 

In late June, I started summer session and took one class, Introduction to Epidemiology.  I learned so much and am so grateful for the knowledge and faculty connections I gained during that time. Epidemiology ended in August, and then I started to seriously study for qualifying exams which take place the Friday before classes start. 

Qualifying exams were rough! It is an all day affair and I had some person performance that I was preparing for during this time too. Actually, the performances took place the day after exams. The last part of the exam was a take home exam and it was due, Monday, as in yesterday which was the first day of classes. 

Long story short, I had an awesome but busy summer. Can't wait to see what the fall semester will bring.
